Instead, they'd still exist with their editing and collaboration histories on local machines all over the world, ready to be uploaded to other Git hosting services (Bitbucket is another great one).<br/>">
                    <h2>What about GitHub?</h2>
                    <p>GitHub is a cloud-based service providing hosting for repositories and a web interface for Git.</p>
                    <p>Alternatives include:</p>

                        <li>Bitbucket</li>

                <section data-notes="* Git really shines when you expect many people to want to use or modify your files. To help illustrate that, let's compare how that would occur with Git and GitHub versus how it would occur in a popular file sharing and collaborative editing product.<br/>* I have a file I want to share with everyone here - let's say it's a lesson plan in a text file. Easy! I'll add it to Googe Drive. Now, I want it to be freely available for anyone to view. No problem, share with everyone on the web. But wait, I want to encourage improvements to this document, and I'd like anyone to be able to propose changes. The problem is, I don't want it to be a free-for-all. Maybe people can proposed edits in the comments and then I can look at them and make them individually? Seems clumsy. Maybe just tell people to make their own copy of the file and work on that one. Perfect! Except I'd really like this document to be kind of a living document. I want to incorporate those changes into this file, which all of you in the room already know about and are already using. Also, if everyone makes their own copy, I'd love to be able to see the brilliant things others have done with their versions, even if I don't necessarily incorporate their changes.<br/>* Also, everyone in this room is smart, but I'd love to make this resource available and editable to the whole world - imagine how much better it woulc get!<br/>* As you can see, the scenario we're creating here, which is really the classic open-source, community-developed scenario, is beginning to depart from what Google Docs is really designed to do.">

                <section data-notes="* So now let's try the same exercise with Github. I create a repo on GitHub, adding tags, keywords etc. I make it a public repo, so it is now searchable and can be viwed by anyone. Already, I've introduced a capability thatdoes not exist in Google Docs - there is no clearinghouse allowing for a global search of every educational resource everyone has ever made public on Google Drive. CONFIRM<br/>* From the start, anyone can fork this repo to make changes. Then, if they want these changes to be incorporated into the MASTER ORIGIN?, they issue a pull request which I can review and approve or not. Even they don't issue a pull request, all their modifications to their own fork are connected with my original repo, so I and others can see what they're doing on their own!<br/>* Critical here is that these changes are not occuring in the browser - you're editing local files on your computer using your programs of choice. Git and Github are just the tools that coordinate the edits of all of those local copies and make them available online.<br/>* These features are really what make Git and GitHub such a great fit for educators - we are, first and foremost, a collaborative, sharing community that bears many similarities to the open source software community Git was originally built for.">

Traditionally, the main way you use Git is (pardon my language here) on the command line, which is really daunting for a lot of people. However, that is changing now that we have a desktop client we can use - in my opinion, this is what's really starting to tip the scales in favor of adoption outside of the programming world.">
